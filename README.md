# Face recognition with NOIR camera on RaspberryPi

## Why:

This is the project for the course of biometric system.

NOIR camera is a rapspberry pi camera module where there is no ir filter, abbinated with 2 ir light let you see image also in low and no light condition with good  contrast in grayscale, so could provide face recognition also in low light condition. 

The model of Raspberry pi that is used is the zero w ( is the  one with lower computational power and wireless connectivity ),  reasonably implementable also in a multimodal biometric system .

## Requirement:

- RaspberryPi ZeroW or 4/3/2

- RaspberryPi NOIR camera + ir lights.

- Any Kind of server with Docker(could also be another RaspberryPi or a remote server)  (for the not standalone version)

- Any other camera device as a phone for enrollment (if you don't want to enroll  on the camera directly ).

-
